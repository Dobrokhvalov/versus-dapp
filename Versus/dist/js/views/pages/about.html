And let others earn ethereum token by making those decisions.<br><br>User can create a versus (poll) by uploading two pictures. Every new versus creates a blockchain transaction, therefore user needs to pay a fee, which depends on the amount of people he or she wants to participate in the poll. After a versus is submited other users are able to participate in the poll.<br><br>When a user makes decision on one or more versuses he or she can submit them in order to create a transaction and save them to the blockchain. Every time a user submits several decisions a fee is paid.<br><br>After a submission user recieves a refund which depends on the amount of decisions he or she has made. A refund amount may be greater than transaction so user can earn tokens from that.
